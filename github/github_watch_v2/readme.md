## Changes in githubarchive bigquery

The previous flattened version of githubarchive timeline in bigquery has been removed and they are using the json format of only required field as either 'payload' or 'other' field.

The significant informations are found in the 'payload' field where the table is before 2012-03 and starting from 2012-04, the significant information will be found in the other field.
